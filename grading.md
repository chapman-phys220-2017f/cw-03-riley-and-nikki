# Instructor comments

1. Module is looking much better.
1. Tests are a good start, but be sure to run them and correct errors. Many of the lines were unfinished or had errors.
1. The notebook is not complete. It is a simple copy-paste of the README, instead of a specification of the problem in your own words. It also does not test all the code, or explain what the tests are.
